# Connect Four Game (Tkinter GUI)

A simple two-player **Connect Four** game implemented in Python with a graphical interface using **tkinter**.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a **6x7** grid.
- Players alternate turns by clicking on a column to drop their piece.
- The disc falls to the **lowest available slot** in the chosen column.
- The first player to connect **four** of their colored discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- After a win, the game displays the winner and shows a **Restart** button.

## Installation

No external installation required!  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed â€” tkinter comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions.

## Running the Game

Save the game code as `connect4_gui.py` (or any filename you prefer), then run it using:

```bash
python connect4_gui.py
```
